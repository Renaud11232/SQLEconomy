#The various SQL queries that will be used in order to interact with the database in order to get/set player balances
#For all queries you can use The dialect of your database of plain standard SQL
#There are two global placeholders:
# {{player_uuid}} : Will be replaced in a prepared statement by the UUID of the player
# {{player_name}} : Will be replaced in a prepared statement by the name of the player
#All money transfers will be done in SQL transactions to prevent issues with concurrent access. (If your database is used on a website for instance)
queries:
  #Single SQL statement that will return the current player balance.
  #This query must return 1 line and 1 column if the player has an account
  #Or an empty set (0 line) if the player doesn't have an account
  get_balance: "SELECT amount FROM balance WHERE player = {{player_uuid}}"
  #SQL statement list (can be only 1) that will modify the database to reflect that the player account has been credited
  #In addition to global placeholders you can use
  # {{amount}} : The amount that will be credited
  # {{new_balance}} : The new total balance for the player
  credit:
    - "UPDATE balance SET amount = {{new_balance}} WHERE player = {{player_uuid}}"
  #SQL statement list (can be only 1) that will modify the database to reflect that the player account has been debited
  #In addition to global placeholders you can use
  # {{amount}} : The amount that will be debited
  # {{new_balance}} : The new total balance for the player
  debit:
    - "UPDATE balance SET amount = {{new_balance}} WHERE player = {{player_uuid}}"
